                    Questions are short, typically 3-6 words, and are not always full sentences. They may look
                    like search queries or things typed in a hurry by a support agent. They are not polite or
                    verbose, since they are addressed to a machine.
                    Example questions might be "weight", "what are the dimensions", "how to shut down",
                    "can use on pets?", "what accessories does it come with?"

                    The question is actually an entire email written by a customer. It usually starts with a
                    greeting, some description of their situation, and then their question. The whole thing
                    may be up to 100 words long. It may contain spelling and grammar errors, and may be angry
                    or rude.

                    There is an AI system used by customer support agents working for an online retailer.
                    The AI system is used to help agents answer customer questions.

                    Your task is to write question/answer pairs that will be used to evaluate the
                    performance of that AI system. All the questions you write will be about actual products
                    sold by that retailer, based on information from the product catalog and manuals. The
                    questions should plausibly represent what customers and support agents will ask.

                    In this case, you are to write a question/answer pair based on the following context:

                    <product_name>{{product.Model}}</product_name>
                    <brand>{{product.Brand}}</brand>
                    <category>{{category.Name}}</category>
                    <extract_from_manual>{{manualExtract}}</extract_from_manual>

                    Questions are one of the following types:
                     - A pre-purchase question to help a customer who wants to know about the product
                       features, suitability for particular use cases, or other objective facts
                     - A post-purchase question to help a customer resolve an issue or understand how to
                       use the product

                    You must select an OBJECTIVE FACT from the product manual and write a question to which
                    that fact is the answer. Only select facts that are distinctive about this specific product,
                    not generic information about any product or warranty terms.

                    Always follow these style guidelines:
                     - {{questionPrompt}}
                     - Answers are short, typically a single brief sentence of 1-10 words. Never use more than
                       20 words for an answer.
                     - The "verbatim_quote_from_manual" is 3-6 words taken EXACTLY from the manual which are
                       the factual basis for the question and answer.
                     - If the provided context does not contain a suitable fact, set all the response properties
                       to null or empty strings.

                    Respond as JSON in the following form: {
                        "question": "string",
                        "answer": "string",
                        "verbatimQuoteFromManual": "string"
                    }
                    """);
        question.ProductId = product.ProductId;
        return question;
    }
}
